A: Based on the list, I infer the sexes of the runners as follows:

1. Male
2. Male
3. Male
4. Male
5. Male
6. Male
7. Male
8. Male
9. Female
10. Male

50. Male

Note that this inference is based on the assumption that the list is predominantly composed of male basketball players, and the female names and relatively lower career points suggest that the remaining individuals are female.
Next, we insert the inferred sexes back into the list.
